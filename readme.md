We are going to create an application that will walk you through all of the steps required to create a character for Dungeons and Dragons.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ We would like for you to be able to go through the initial setup of the character for all of the required stats. Also we want to make it so that you can keep track and update these stats during the course of the game. We will be communicating through Google Hangouts and email and will be using Github for version control.

As for parts of the project we will be creating. We will have a menu for you to choose either to start the initial creation or update specific stats. We will have a class for each group of stats to make it easier to update only what you need and not have to go through all of the other fields to get there. As far as Who will be doing what, we haven't had the opportunity for all of us to be able to discuss who will be performing which task although there will be 6 classes that will be required each of us will be responsible for 2 of them each with one person responsible for one of the classes plus the menu.

As for the goals of the group, we will first work on the Menu that will be done by 2/1/17. After that we will begin to work on each class with there being 6 classes we will separate who will be doing which of them and they will need to be done within 2 - 3 weeks (no later than 2/22/17).  After that we will be merging all of our classes and menu the week after that. Giving us the last week to debug any issues that may occur.
